# Table Cloth

Table Cloth gives you an easy to use DSL for creating and rendering tables in rails.

The primary goal of Table Cloth is to remove the complexity that usually comes with making tables with dynamic content.
HTML Tables frequently can get out of hand when you start to add conditionals, removing columns, etc..

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'table_cloth'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Table Cloth can use defined tables in app/tables or you can build them on the fly.


Table models can be generated using rails generators.

```
$ rails g table User
```

It will make this:

```ruby
class UserTable < TableCloth::Base
  # Define columns with the #column method
  # column :name, :email

  # Columns can be provided a block
  #
  # column :name do |object|
  #   object.name.downcase
  # end
  #
  # Columns can also have conditionals if you want.
  # The conditions are checked against the table's methods.
  # As a convience, the table has a #view method which will return the current view context.
  # This gives you access to current user, params, etc...
  #
  # column :email, if: :admin?
  #
  # def admin?
  #   view.current_user.admin?
  # end
  #
  # Actions give you the ability to create a column for any actions you'd like to provide.
  # Pass a block with an arity of 2, (object, view context).
  # You can add as many actions as you want.
  #
  # actions do
  #   action {|object| link_to "Edit", edit_object_path(object) }
  # end
end
```

Go ahead and modify it to suit your needs, pick the columns, conditions, actions, etc...

In your view, you would then use this code:

```erb
<%= simple_table_for @users, with: UserTable %>
```

Or if you want more customization:

```erb
<%= simple_table_for @users do |t| %>
  <% t.column :name %>
  <% t.column :email %>
  <% t.actions do %>
    <% action {|user| link_to "View", user } %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

## Columns

You can create your own column by making a class that responds to ```.value(object, view)```

```ruby
class ImageColumn < TableCloth::Column
  def value(object, view)
    view.raw(view.image_tag(object.image_url))
  end
end
```

In your table:

```erb
<%= simple_table_for @users do |table| %>
  <% table.column :name %>
  <% table.column :image, using: ImageColumn %>
<% end %>
```

## Actions

A lot of tables have an actions column to give you the full CRUD effect. They can be painful but Table Cloth incorporates a way to easily add them to your definition:

```ruby
class UserTable < TableCloth::Base
  column :name

  actions do
    action {|object| link_to 'View', object }
    action(if: :admin?) {|object| link_to 'Delete', object, method: :delete }
  end

  def admin?
    view.current_user.admin?
  end
end
```


## Configuration

Create an initializer called ```table_cloth.rb```

It should look like this:

```ruby
TableCloth::Configuration.configure do |config|
  config.table.class = 'table table-bordered'
  config.thead.class = ''
  config.tbody.class = ''
  config.tr.class =''
  config.th.class =''
  config.td.class =''
end
```

You can also configure specific tables separately:

```ruby
class UserTable < TableCloth::Base
  column :name, :email

  actions do
    action {|object| link_to "Edit", edit_object_path(object) }
  end

  config.table.class = ''
  config.thead.class = ''
  config.th.class    = ''
  config.tbody.class = ''
  config.tr.class    = ''
  config.td.class    = ''
end
```

You can set any value on table element configurations. For example:

```ruby
config.table.cellpadding = 1
config.td.valign = 'top'
```

You also have the option to specify options on a specific column with the ```td_options``` key.

```ruby
class UserTable < TableCloth::Base
  column :name, td_options: { class: "awesome-column" }
end
```

Table header (```th```) elements can be configured in a similar fashion with the ```th_options``` key.

Not good enough? Fine... you can do row / column specific config as well for a TD.

```ruby
class UserTable < TableCloth::Base
  column :name do |user|
    [user.name, {class: "#{user.type}-user"}]
  end
end
```

This would render something alow the lines of:

```html
<td class="admin-user">Robert Ross</td>
```
